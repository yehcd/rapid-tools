This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

<!-- # ```{r} -->
<!-- # plot(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.




# LIBRARIES 
```{r}
source("../resources/commonFunctions.R")
source("../resources/hicFunctions.R")

```


# BASIC SETUP
Reading and loading basic data, make GRanges for DSB


IMPORTANT: To use this R Notebook, the appropriate HIC datafile must first be downloaded!
e.g., for K562 cells:

  https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF621AIY/@@download/ENCFF621AIY.hic

```{r}
pathToHiC <- "<REPLACE WITH PATH TO HIC DATA (e.g., ENCFF621AIY.hic)>"


# resolution is binSize to use; should match between RaPID-seq data & HiC/4C data. 
# default: 25kbps.
resolution <- 25000
regionSize <- 5E6

# nominally 10X size of RAD51 bound region (i.e., 15kbps, each side)
dsbMaskSize <- 10 * 15000
```


# MAIN LOADING
mass loading of all sample definitions into a list
```{r}
sampleFiles <- dir(path = "./example/", pattern = ".txt")

ls.sampleFiles <-
  lapply(
    X = paste0("./example/", sampleFiles),
    FUN = read.csv,
    header = TRUE,
    sep = "\t",
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )

df.sampleFiles <- ls.sampleFiles %>% as.data.frame()
# df.sampleFiles
```


Generic loading of all RaPID.bw files and running through re-scaling with HiC data
and aggregating into a single list file

This process will take several minutes per sample.

```{r}
# initialize
setwd("./example/")
ls.final <- list()

#df.samples <- df.sampleFiles[1:1,]    # subset testing
df.samples <- df.sampleFiles
df.samples

for (i in 1:nrow(df.samples))
{
  # load data initially as GRanges, then unlist to dataframe
  result <- aggregateRapidHic(
    pathToHiC = pathToHiC,
    pathToRapid = df.samples$rapid_datafile[i],
    dsbSite = df.samples$dsbSiteString[i],
    resolution = resolution,
    regionSize = regionSize,
    dsbMaskSize = dsbMaskSize
  ) %>% mcols %>% as.data.frame()
  
  # append read data to list
  ls.final <- append(ls.final, list(result))
  names(ls.final)[i] <- df.samples$shortName[i]
}

ls.final
```


dump 'ls.final' list object to file to avoid having to reload data & re-calculate HiC/BALANCED values again
```{r}
dumpName <-
  "./example/HBB_HicRaPID.RData"

saveRDS(object = ls.final, file = dumpName)
```
